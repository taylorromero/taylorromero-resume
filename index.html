        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Taylor Romero and I am from the San Fernando Valley, California. I am a fourth-year biology major at the University of California, Riverside.  I am very involved with multiple organizations in school that focuses on both the medical field and the dental field. For instance, I am a CPR instructor at the School of Medicine, where I teach undergraduate students about life-saving skills. I also teach them about the importance of CPR by showing them good techniques. Not only am I a CPR instructor, but I also teach kindergartens the significance of oral hygiene. I show the children how to properly keep their teeth clean and strong. Outside of school, I am a college success mentor where I advise freshman students transition from high school to college. I organize workshops for them, so they can gain good advice about college. <br><br>

        I will be the first person in my family to graduate in a four-year public university. I can not wait to graduate college because I want to encourage my three sisters to also attend and graduate college. After graduation, I will be working at a dental office as a dental assistant and receptionist. My goal to work at a dental office is to get more experience in the dental field. My aspiration is to become a dentist and learn how the process of how a dental office works. I love interacting with people and helping them with whatever they need. I always want to work in a profession that allows me to work on my manual dexterity. I like working with my hands and interacting with people. I hope working at a dental office will motivate me to continue my education to become a dentist. Outside of work, my goal is to visit as many countries as I can. I have never traveled outside of the country but England will be the first country I will visit. I want to visit the Big Ben in London and see a soccer game. Another goal is to get an apartment with my friends in Los Angeles.<br><br> 


During my free time, I love to play soccer, the guitar and hang out with friends. My favorite soccer team is Barcelona. I played soccer since I was six years old. As I get older, my goal is to become a club soccer coach as a hobby. I love playing and teaching the game of soccer.  I started learning to play the guitar when I was in middle school. Every so often I try to learn a new song to play and teach it to my friends and family. My favorite city to hang out with my friends is in  Los Angeles. There are so many things to do in Los Angeles, such as going to the beach, hiking, and amusement parks. My amusement park is Disneyland because I loved watching Disney movies as a kid. I am very thankful that I live in Los Angeles because there are so many things to do.
